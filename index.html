                Hello! Thank you for visiting my very first webpage. This is very exciting to be able to learn web development from scratch. 
                I know it will take a lot hard work and persistence to complete the course 
                but I look forward to all the new skills I will learn!
            </p>

            <p>
                Pictured to my right is my husky bae name Mason, 
                we just celebrated his 5th birthday a couple months ago! 
                Mason loves to run and play and get into trouble.
            </p>
